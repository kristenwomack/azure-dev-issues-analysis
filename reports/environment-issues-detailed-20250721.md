## Environment Management Pain Points

Based on the analysis of 840 environment-related issues, the following patterns emerge:

1. **Environment Configuration Complexity** - Many issues relate to setting up and managing multiple environments
2. **Variable Management** - Environment variable handling and precedence causes confusion
3. **Multi-Environment Workflows** - Users struggle with promoting between dev/staging/prod environments  
4. **Environment Switching** - Lack of clear commands for switching between environments
5. **State Management** - Infrastructure state management across environments

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Focus on the 306 open environment issues
2. **High Priority**: Address the most commented issues (high community engagement)
3. **User Experience**: Simplify environment setup and switching workflows
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive environment management guides
5. **Tooling**: Develop better `azd env` commands and validation
