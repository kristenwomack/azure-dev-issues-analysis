# Features Already Available vs. Requested

## Analysis Framework

**Goal**: Identify features that exist but users aren't aware of them, revealing communication and documentation gaps.

## Methodology

### Research Approach
- Compare open feature requests against Azure Developer CLI documentation
- Check CLI help output, README.md, and feature documentation  
- Look for requests for features that already exist in current version
- Identify communication and documentation gaps

### Research Areas

#### CLI Commands and Flags
- Available commands vs. requested functionality
- Hidden or lesser-known flags
- Command combinations that achieve requested features

#### VS Code Extension Features  
- Extension capabilities vs. user requests
- UI features vs. requested improvements
- Integration features vs. workflow requests

#### Template Capabilities
- Built-in template features vs. requests
- Customization options vs. enhancement requests
- Template ecosystem vs. missing template requests

#### Environment Management Features
- Environment switching capabilities
- Configuration management options
- State management features

#### Authentication Methods
- Available auth options vs. requests
- SSO and enterprise auth features
- Token management capabilities

#### Deployment Options
- Available deployment targets
- Configuration options
- Advanced deployment features
