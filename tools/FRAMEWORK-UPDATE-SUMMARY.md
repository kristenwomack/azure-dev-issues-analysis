- Added full 2023 quarterly coverage (Q1-Q4)
- Extended 2024 coverage through Q4
- Updated 2025 coverage through Q2
- Total: 11 temporal periods vs. original 6

### 3. Script Enhancements
**File:** `tools/run_queries.py`
- Updated temporal query definitions for complete history
- Added repository metadata in documentation
- Extended analysis period references
- Updated client tracking query scope
- Added SAML authentication notes

### 4. Report Updates
**Files Updated:**
- `reports/open-issues-analysis.md`
- `reports/issue-analysis-report.md` 
- `reports/action-plan.md`

**Key Changes:**
- Updated analysis periods to cover complete history
- Added real repository statistics (839 open issues)
- Enhanced client tracking analysis framework
- Added authentication requirements documentation

### 5. Documentation Enhancement
**New File:** `README-Usage.md`
- Complete usage guide for the analysis framework
- Prerequisites and setup instructions
- Troubleshooting for Azure organization SAML requirements
