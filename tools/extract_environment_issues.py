## Summary

This report contains open environment management related issues from the Azure Developer CLI repository. Issues are identified by keywords related to environment configuration, variables, multi-environment workflows, and environment management commands.

**Quick Stats:**
- **Open Issues**: {len(open_issues)}
- **Average Age**: {sum(calculate_age(i['created_at']) for i in open_issues) // len(open_issues) if open_issues else 0} days

## Environment Management Pain Points

Based on the analysis of {len(open_issues)} open environment-related issues, the following patterns emerge:

1. **Environment Configuration Complexity** - Many issues relate to setting up and managing multiple environments
2. **Variable Management** - Environment variable handling and precedence causes confusion
3. **Multi-Environment Workflows** - Users struggle with promoting between dev/staging/prod environments  
4. **Environment Switching** - Lack of clear commands for switching between environments
5. **State Management** - Infrastructure state management across environments

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Focus on the {len(open_issues)} open environment issues
2. **High Priority**: Address the most commented issues (high community engagement)
3. **User Experience**: Simplify environment setup and switching workflows
4. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive environment management guides
5. **Tooling**: Develop better `azd env` commands and validation
